# To do

  * set 1 will be the set using arima (fix params or not?)
  * if 1 is fixed, use 2 with new params (1 obs shouldnt change too much)
  * Acquire google Trends Data in long format
  * Try searching for "Croatia" in "Travel" and use worldwide or maybe some europ. countries
  * use this specific data for arimaX
  * try using this and other search results from short term tests to use ML 
  * Maybe meta-model in the end? Combin
