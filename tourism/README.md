# To do

  * Compare long and short data results! Maybe some econometric models necessary? More google search data using the terms, those from the short term models and also some county specific! Meaning: For Spain we should also search for (term) + Spain. 
  * Calculate percentage of domnestic tourism, include these calcs into model and search (e.g. Italy, many inhabitants are going on domnestic holiday).
  * Use search terms from short period data in long periods, may be good add. predictors
  * Test!! Test with real data and calculate error statistics (RMSE etc.)
