# Rolling forecast

## To do: 
### 1) Check if we need to estimate all ML approaches for each timestamp or can we estimate the
#### models once and then just predict? Need to evaluate.
### 2) Write function for ARIMAX models that estimate the models for each step.
### 3) Perform ensemble learning: Create an approach using ARIMAX and ML combined.
### 4) Estimate for all countries.
