# Outline
This code repository contains all of GladGan's submissions and projects. On the top level,
we have two folders: `1_ongoing`and `2_archive`. The former currently contains the ongoing nowcasting competitions for trade statistics. In the archive, we find the submissions for the first round on PVI, PPI and tourism data. In addition, it contains a not yet finished project on the detection of structural breaks in time series using COMEXT data.
